#python design pattern

#language neutral, dynamic and incomplete by design to promote customization

"""
Creational:
	USed to create objects in a systematic way
		Benefits: Flexibility
Structural:
	used to establish usefull relationships between software comonents in certain configs
	To accomplish a goal: both function and nonfunctional

	Different goals yield different structures
Beheivoural Patterns:
	Best practives of objects interaction
	Define the protocols



Object-oriented mechanisms used:
	Creational: Polymorphism
	Stuctural: inheretance
	Beheivoral: Methods and their signatures 

OO. objects and classes
	Attributes and beheivors
	methods represent the beheivors

Inheretance:
	establish relasionships between classes as parent and child

Polymmorphism:
	Allows child classes to be instantiated and treated as the same type as its parent


A Pattern Context:
	Participants: Classes involved to form a design pattern

	Quality attributes: Non functional attributes such as Usability, modifiablity, reliablity, performmance etc

	Forces: Various factors or trade-offs to consider. manifested in quality attributes

	Consequences: consequences

A pattern language:
	name:
		should capture gist of pattern
	context:
		provides scenario whre patterns may be used
	problem:
		design challenge that pattern is addressing
	solution:
	specifies the a pattern *relationships among elements

	related patterns: list other patterns, used together with the pattern being described that are similar but differnt
